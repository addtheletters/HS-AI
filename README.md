# HS-AI
Code written for high school Artificial Intelligence, here for archival purposes.

Code is divided by the school year quarter in which it was written.

## Quarter 1 Highlights
Quarter 1 was focused on searching.
- implementation of 3-element vectors in vector.py
- DFS and BFS graph navigation in routes.py
- 2D graphics done with tkinter
- [A* / A Star pathfinding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) in astar.py
- [Nelder-Mead downhill simplex method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelder%E2%80%93Mead_method) in labnmead.py

## Quarter 2 Highlights
Quarter 2 was focused on AI for solving / playing games.
- Converting repeating decimals to fractions in recurringdecimal.py
- AI that plays [Ghost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_(game)) in ghost.py
- AI that plays [Othello / Reversi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi) in revised_othello1.py. (Older versions also present.) Uses methods such as
    - N-ply [minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) decision making
    - [Alpha-beta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning) pruning
- Solving [Sudokus](http://i.imgur.com/fs3Lkmj.png) in sudokusolver.py
- Fast word lookups with a [trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) in trie.py
- Generating from [Wolfram's Elementary Cellular Automata Rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_cellular_automaton) in cellular.py

## Quarter 3 Highlights
Quarter 3 was focused on machine vision and image manipulation.
- In machinevision.py:
    - [Gaussian Smoothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_blur)
    - [Thresholding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thresholding_(image_processing))
    - [Sobel Transfrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobel_operator)
    - [Canny Edge Detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector)
- Detecting lines with [Hough Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hough_transform) in houghtransform.py
- Experimenting with circular permutations in permutequiz.py
- Monte-Carlo experiment on unique birthdays in uniquebirthdays.py
